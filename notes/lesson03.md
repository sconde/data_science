##Analyzing Messy Data 1

Before diving into the nitty-gritty details of data munching, I
want to ask if you've ever had to analyze really messy
or unorganized data? Even if you&#39;re not a data scientist, you&#39;ve
probably dealt with unwieldy data at some point in your life.
Maybe you had trouble reading the receipts from a bake
sale you organized, or you tried to keep track of your
personal budget in an Excel spreadsheet. What methods or tools did
you use to make your life easier? Please share your experience
with the class by typing your answer in the forum. I&#39;ve added
a link to the discussion thread for you in the instructor comments.
